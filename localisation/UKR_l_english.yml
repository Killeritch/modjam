 UKR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer’s head. There’s also Rick’s nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they’re not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick & Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick’s existential catchphrase “Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,” which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev’s Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon’s genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂And yes, by the way, i DO have a Rick & Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the ladies’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎"

 UKR_appoint_shulhyn:0 "Appoint Shulhyn Foreign Minister"
 UKR_appoint_shulhyn_desc:0 "A social democrat, and foreign minister to the Chief Otaman himself before the ORUN regime, Oleksandr Shulhyn would prove useful in improving our international relations. Perhaps bringing him into the cabinet would also serve to nullify his dangerous popularity."
 UKR_political_change:0 "Political Change"
 UKR_political_change_desc:0 "Since the assassination of the Chief Otaman, Symon Petliura, 10 years ago, Ukraine has been in a state of political stagnation. The ORUN seized power shortly after Petliura's death, with the military agreeing to cease opposition to the coup on the condition that the party's most radical policies were not implemented. Now, Ukraine hangs in the balance, between several power blocs, and we must decide which to empower."
 UKR_strengthen_bandera:0 "Strengthen Bandera"
 UKR_chornomortsi_desc:0 "The Chornomortsi, originally simply a scouting organisation for teenage boys, has become a formidable paramilitary under its leader and founder, Roman Shukhevych. More revolutionary measures may be needed to bring Ukraine to greatness, and were we to promote Shukheyvich and his Chornomortsi, relaxing the laws around their practices, we may increase their popularity."
 UKR_chornomortsi:0 "Empower The Chornomortsi"
 UKR_strengthen_bandera_desc:0 "Chairman Stepan Bandera's vision for Ukraine has been routinely impeded by disloyal figures in the military, and usurpers within the party. We must act to establish centralised power."

 UKR_military_leadership_desc:0 "Ukraine has spent a decade stagnant, in the withering hands of the ORUN. These 'radicals' are of course nothing but socialists in disguise; Ukraine needs her true sons and daughters to take the reigns, and guide Ukraine away from corruption."
 UKR_begin_purge:0 "Begin The Purge"
 UKR_begin_purge_desc:0 "All those not unwaveringly loyal to the supreme leader shall be thoroughly investigated. It was a mistake after seizing power to cower to special interests, and let the democrats, socialists, and seditionists roam free. Ukraine shall be purged of these evils."
 UKR_appoint_shukhevych:0 "Appoint Shukhevych Interior Minister"
 UKR_appoint_shukhevych_desc:0 "The central figure in the revolutionary wing of the ORUN is Roman Shukhevych. He is young and dynamic, and could offer invaluable energy and direction to the Ukrainian state."
 UKR_appoint_sinkler:0 "Appoint Sinkler Interior Minister"
 UKR_appoint_sinkler_desc:0 "Perhaps the most respected member of the Ukrainian General Staff is the old aristocrat, Volodymyr Sinkler. Descended from Anglo-Swedish nobles in service to the Tsar, upon the collapse of Russia in 1917, he immediately declared himself for Ukrainian independence, and is widely popular amongst soldiers."
 UKR_appoint_skoropadskyi:0 "Appoint Skoropadskyi Interior Minister"
 UKR_appoint_skoropadskyi_desc:0 "A noble of Ukrainian blood, believed by many to be a legitimate candidate for Hetman of Ukraine, Pavlo Skoropadskyi is a devout royalist and prominent military figure. Not so popular amongst the lower ranks of the army or the workers, he finds his support amongst the officer core and big businessmen of Ukraine."
 UKR_chornomortsi_divisions:0 "Sanction Chornomortsi Divisions"
 UKR_chornomortsi_divisions_desc:0 "With its recent surge in popularity, the Chornomortsi paramilitary has grown to considerable size, numbering several hundred thousand members. The unofficial militant wing of the ORUN should now be slowly integrated into the state army, now it is virtually equal in strength."
 UKR_agitate_aristocrats:0 "Agitate Against The Aristocrats"
 UKR_agitate_aristocrats_desc:0 "We must let the workers, farmers, and soldiers of Ukraine know that it is not the ORUN or radicalist ideas that have left them dissatisfied. Rather, it is those who have stopped the party from implementing its agenda; the wealthy industrialists, the decadent generals, and the landed nobility."
 UKR_purge_democrats:0 "Purge Democrats"
 UKR_purge_democrats_desc:0 "'Social Democrats', 'liberals', all just cunning aliases for subversive communists. This is a dangerous world, and for the good of Ukraine, those who wish to undermine the regime by stirring up trade unions and soldiers' councils should be despatched immediately."
 UKR_purge_army:0 "Purge The Army"
 UKR_purge_army_desc:0 "When the chairman came to power in 1936, it was dissenters in the military that threatened civil war should we enforce the policies of the ORUN. Now they are complacent, they think us in the palms of their hands. We should strike quickly, remove them from power, and punish their arrogance."

 ukraine.6.t:0 "Ukraine In 1936"
 ukraine.6.desc:0 "Following the collapse of the Russian Tsardom in 1917, Ukrainians, being the largest and most influential of the empire's minorities, were quick to declare independence. After a an exceedingly short war with Russia for independence, Russia agreed to a peace deal, due to the threat of the bolsheviks. From 1918 until 1926, Ukraine maintained a fragile democracy under the Chief Otaman, Symon Petliura, a figure beloved by all. On the 13th of July 1926, a Jewish anarchist shot Petliura during a pro-democracy rally in Kharkov. The ensuing chaos was seized upon by Stepan Bandera, and his Organisation of Radical Ukrainian Nationalists (ORUN), who stormed the presidential palace in Kiev, backed by the majority of the populace who were fired up with anti-semitic rhetoric. Now, Ukraine has for 10 years been in a state of stagnation. A fragile agreement between the ORUN and the Ukrainian General Staff signed in november 1926 has limited the radicals' powers, and concentrated much of Ukraine's political and economic power in the hands of aristocrats and oligarchs. However, with the military becoming increasingly complacent, and more revolutionary radicals becoming prominent, this uneasy stability is soon to come crashing down."
