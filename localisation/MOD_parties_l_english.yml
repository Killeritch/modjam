 totalist_subtype:0 "Totalism"
 totalist_subtype_desc:0 "Totalism is both a specific ideology, and a category sometimes given to name various radical left wing ideologies with similar characteristics. As an ideology, Totalism promotes a new direction for socialism in the world, emphasising the the role of the socialist state as the core ideal of the nation, while devaluing or abandoning the Marxist ideas of worker empowerment and a classless utopia. Totalists look to centralise and expand the governments' powers in socialist states, believing that the goal of the government is to build socialism in the state, and often use nationalist and militarist rhetoric and policies. Due to their authoritarian nature, other authoritarian or totalitarian socialist ideologies have gained the name "Totalist" even if they are not affiliated with the Totalist charter."
 syndicalist_subtype:0 "Syndicalism"
 syndicalist_subtype_desc:0 "Anarcho-Syndicalism is the leading Marxist revolutionary ideology, which promotes democratic federations of collectivised trade unions as the basic political and economic units of the socialist state. Trade unions are equally owned by all the workers who are members in them, and have complete economic and political control over the workplaces they organise, and are given great amounts of autonomy from the central government. On a larger scale the various trade unions elect members to regional and national trade union congresses, which form the legislative and executive powers of the central government."
 radical_socialist_subtype:0 "Radical Socialism"
 radical_socialist_subtype_desc:0 "Radical Socialism is a catch-all phrase for the various Socialist, Communist and Anarchist ideologies that aren't directly associated with Syndicalism. Countries with this ideology operate with a socialist economy, usually accompanied with some kind of democratic form of government; Their ultimate goal is to create a paradise for the working class, the details of which varies from movement to movement."
 social_democrat_subtype:0 "Social Democracy"
 social_democrat_subtype_desc:0 "Social Democracy is an ideology whose goal is to reform capitalism and humanise it by aligning it with the ethical ideals of social welfare while maintaining the capitalist mode of production, rather than creating an alternative socialist economic system. While usually promoting a plutocratic form of government and a heavily regulated market economy, some more radical streams exist."
 social_liberal_subtype:0 "Social Liberalism"
 social_liberal_subtype_desc:0 "Social liberalism is a variation on mainstream Market liberalism, with the main difference being is the inclusion of various civil freedoms as basic human rights. Professing progressive social and economic policies the social liberals aim to create a society where every individual is free to live his own life with full opportunities regardless of their status"
 market_liberal_subtype:0 "Market Liberalism"
 market_liberal_subtype_desc:0 "Market liberals see themselves as the mainstream liberal ideology. The main tenants of Market liberalism are an unregulated free market and a democratic plutocratic political system. Market liberals believe that the freer the market the freer the people, and they will staunchly defend the political and economic rights of the individual."
 social_conservative_subtype:0 "Social Conservatism"
 social_conservative_subtype_desc:0 "Conservatism is a political ideology centred on preserving traditional beliefs, attitudes and philosophy as well as the traditional power dynamic of society while using the democratic system. Opposed to both radical and moderate changes to the status quo, conservatives want to keep society in order and stable. Usually promote a regulated market economy, but more liberal economic policies aren't unheard of"
 authoritarian_democrat_subtype:0 "Authoritarian Democracy"
 authoritarian_democrat_subtype_desc:0 "Authoritarian democracy is an ideology that combines a strong executive power with a representative parliament and a partial democratic political system. Authoritarian democratic regimes often take a conservative stance on social issues and promote liberal-capitalist economies with limited state intervention. The aim of these regimes are to maintain national stability and provide the people both a popular and responsible government."
 paternal_autocrat_subtype:0 "Paternal Autocracy"
 paternal_autocrat_subtype_desc:0 "Paternal Autocracy is not a political ideology in the normal sense of the word, but rather a general term for the attitude that these governments hold towards their citizens: The people are all subjects of the leader, either a king or a dictator, and it is the leader's job and duty to lead the state and society towards the righteous and best path while uniting the people of under his benevolent protection. These countries usually have a very authoritarian government, conservative social views and a state controlled economy."
 national_populist_subtype:0 "National Populism"
 national_populist_subtype_desc:0 "Encompassing a variety of ultra-nationalist and militaristic movements, National Populism typically venerates devotion to the state, uniting the people under a strong leader and a corporate economy.
