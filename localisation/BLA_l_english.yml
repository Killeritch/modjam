 #Events - General
 BLA_general.1.t:0 "The state of Bulgaria in 1936"
 BLA_general.1.d:0 "Bulgaria has undergone some major changes in the recent past: After Boiko Petrov rose to power with the Authoritarian Democrat party as a result of a governmental crisis, chaos ensued in the Balkans. Albania, with divided leadership, turned to Bulgaria for protection from its enemies. This led to the Bulgarian-Albanian Amnexation treaty, which marks the birth of the Bulgarian-Albanian Union State (mostly just called Greater Bulgaria). The country is essentially a union between Bulgaria and Albania, with Bulgaria as the major partner. After the union was formed, a crisis in Libya led to intervention by the newly created state, and as a result the nation gained territories in northern Libya and set up a colonial government there. Bulgaria is increasingly involving itself in international affairs, and everyone wonders what the future of the country will hold..."
