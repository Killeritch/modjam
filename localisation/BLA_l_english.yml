 #Events - General
 BLA_general.1.t:0 "The state of Bulgaria in 1936"
 BLA_general.1.d:0 "Bulgaria has undergone some major changes in the recent past: After Boiko Petrov rose to power with the Authoritarian Democrat party as a result of a governmental crisis, chaos ensued in the Balkans. Albania, with divided leadership, turned to Bulgaria for protection from its enemies. This led to the Bulgarian-Albanian Amnexation treaty, which marks the birth of the Bulgarian-Albanian Union State (mostly just called Greater Bulgaria). The country is essentially a union between Bulgaria and Albania, with Bulgaria as the major partner. After the union was formed, a crisis in Libya led to intervention by the newly created state, and as a result the nation gained territories in northern Libya and set up a colonial government there. Bulgaria is increasingly involving itself in international affairs, and everyone wonders what the future of the country will hold..."
 BLA_general.1.a:0 "We shall rise!"
 BLA_general.2.t:0 "The Kostov Case"
 BLA_general.2.d:0 "A man named Mihael Kostov has approached our air corps several times in recent days asking about funding for the development of new aeroplane technology. He has been described as being a bit crazy, but certainly seems to know what he is talking about. He has requested government funding to complete his project, and thus our Air Force administration forwarded it to us. What shall we do?"
 BLA_general.2.a:0 "Let's hope he can provide..."
 BLA_general.2.b:0 "We cant just waste money like that!"
 BLA_general.3.t:0 "Mihael Kostov delivers"
 BLA_general.3.d:0 "The Man we gave funding to about two weeks ago, Mihael Kostov, has proved that he was worth the money. He sent in his blueprints to the BAF R&D, and they approved them as being exceptionally well made and thought out. This new method of Bomber design will give us an edge in air technology."
 BLA_general.3.a:0 "Great!"
 BLA_MihaelKostovBomber2:0 "We will receive an improved Bomber Design to build in our factories."
 BLA_general.4.t:0 "Developing Africa"
 BLA_general.4.d:0 "Our colony in Africa is very poorly developed. We have some political clout available, and we could use it to improve the land around Tripoli. It would not help us directly, but we would surely benefit from having strong subjects..."
 BLA_general.4.a:0 "Yes, that sounds like a good idea."
 BLA_general.4.b:0 "Let's allocate the resources somewhere else."
 BLA_general.5.t:0 "The Sofia Subway"
 BLA_general.5.d:0 "In 1934, our great country started constructing a subway system in our capital of Sofia. The network has been finished yesterday and the infrastructure will not only be used to transport civilians, but it is available for the army as well. Extending to the most important military bases in the area, this ensures quick and if necessary, unseen transport of our troops to key areas."
 BLA_general.5.a:0 "Good work."
 BLA_general.6.t:0 "Decentralization efforts begin"
 BLA_general.6.d:0 "After our country made the decision to decentralize the government, the first steps have just now been initiaded. This will cost us a considerable amount of political clout, but we will unite the nation by granting more power to local governments."
 BLA_general.6.a:0 "Good."
 
 #Events - Political
 BLA_political.1.t:0 "Albania demands more rights!"
 BLA_political.1.d:0 "We have always made it clear to Albania that they are the minor partner in our union - but recently, they have been acting up, demanding more influence. Should we calm them by giving them some or repress them?"
 BLA_political.1.a:0 "They can have some more influence."
 BLA_political.1.b:0 "We are the leaders of this union!"
 #2, 3 and 4 have been removed because the modder who did the country they related to quit.
 BLA_political.5.t:0 "Expansion into Libya"
 BLA_political.5.d:0 "The country of Libya lies right next to our colony in Africa, and although it is not rich in resources, it is valuable strategic territory. It is currently controlled by backwards warlords, so we wouldn't get too much flak for trying to attack them. It would still be a considerable effort however..."
 BLA_political.5.a:0 "Do it! We must expand our colonies!"
 BLA_political.5.b:0 "Let's try to negotiate with them instead..."
 BLA_LafDiplomatic:0 "We will attempt to form an Alliance with them."
 BLA_political.5.c:0 "No, we shouldn't mess with Libya."
 BLA_political.6.t:0 "Bulgaria wants to form an alliance"
 BLA_political.6.d:0 "Bulgaria has approached us about forming an alliance/sphere of influence, and they would like to invite us to it. We could gain some benefits from this, but we will also be put under their influence. What should we do?"
 BLA_political.6.a:0 "Sure, this can only strengthen our position."
 BLA_political.6.b:0 "We will remain independent!"
 BLA_political.7.t:0 "Libya cooperates"
 BLA_political.7.d:0 "Libya has stated their intent to cooperate with us, and has agreed to form an alliance between our governments. We now have our own sphere of influence."
 BLA_political.7.a:0 "Our power grows!"
 BLA_political.8.t:0 "Libya refuses to cooperate"
 BLA_political.8.d:0 "Libya has refused to cooperate with us, and stated that our inquiry was an insult to their independence! This makes us look weak in international eyes and it might be best to not negotiate with them again anytime soon."
 BLA_political.8.a:0 "Damn it!"
 BLA_political.9.t:0 "Elections drawing closer"
 BLA_political.9.d:0 "The Elections of 1937 are drawing closer, so we are faced with the question who to officially support. We can support the three main parties, or noone at all. What shall we do?"
 BLA_political.9.a:0 "Support the NDP"
 BLA_political.9.b:0 "Support the CB"
 BLA_political.9.c:0 "Support the LBP"
 BLA_political.9.e:0 "Support noone."
 BLA_GTU_MaltaSale:0 "We will approach them about selling Malta to us."
 BLA_political.10.t:0 "The sale of Malta"
 BLA_political.10.d:0 "The Island of Malta is currently owned by the Greeks. Since they have no historical business in there, and we have an ambition to expand our countries influence in the mediterranean, maybe we could try and buy the island of them. We would have to spend a lot of political power to make it happen though..."
 BLA_political.10.a:0 "Sure, begin negotiations right away."
 BLA_political.10.b:0 "Let's just lay claim to the island."
 BLA_GTU_MaltaClaim:0 "This will worsen our relations with them."
 BLA_political.10.c:0 "No, we don't have any business in Malta either."
 BLA_political.11.t:0 "The sale of Malta"
 BLA_political.11.d:0 "The Bulgarians have approached us about selling the Island of Malta to them. They offer to provide us with political opportunities and money if we leave the island to them - this would mean losing influence in the mediterranean, however, which is surely what they are after too. Should we do it?"
 BLA_political.11.a:0 "Yes, we don't really need it anyway."
 BLA_political.11.b:0 "Malta will remain Greek!"
 BLA_political.12.t:0 "The sale of Malta"
 BLA_political.12.d:0 "The Greeks have sold Malta to us! The island has already been transfereed and the government is setting up local administration. Success!"
 BLA_political.12.a:0 "Hooray!"
 
 #Events - News
 BLA_news.1.t:0 "Bulgaria announces plans against Libya"
 BLA_news.1.d:0 "The Government of Bulgaria has publicly stated its intentions to expand their territories in Africa by aggressive actions towards the state of Libya, a neighbor of their colony. It remains to be seen if this will actually escalate into a full-scale war, but tensions have certainly been caused by this."
 BLA_news.1.a:0 "It seems like they want to expand..."
 
 #Events - Revolution
 BLA_revolution.1.t:0 "NDP losing support"
